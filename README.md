Requirements:

The application should display one question with four options per page.

Include "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through the questions.

The state should be maintained to know which question is currently being displayed.

Ensure that users cannot navigate to the previous question if they are on the first question, and cannot navigate to the next question if they are on the last question.

Use React functional components and hooks for state management.

User can mark the correct option (use radio buttons).

Submit button should appear at the last question only.

On pressing submit button, test score should appear.
